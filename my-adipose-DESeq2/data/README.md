# Data folder

- Put **raw count** `.txt` files in `data/counts/`. Each file is one sample, with 2 columns (no header): `GeneID` and `Count`.
- Save your **metadata** as `data/metadata.csv` (use `metadata_template.csv` as a guide).
- This repo ignores big data by default (`.gitignore`), so you won't accidentally upload private data.
